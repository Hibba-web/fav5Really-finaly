        <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <p>Every one of us has some kind of liking or disliking for certain things in life. Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun. Drawing is my favorite hobby. I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my mother who always encourages me by helping me and draw and she shows me some of her drawing which are lovely. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist. You just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing. When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. However drawing is not as easy as it seems to be. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colors with me. My colors are my best friend. I like drawing since I was 3 year old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive. I imagine all kinds of strange things to show it on a piece of paper such as a beautiful house in heaven and more. I have decorated my room with lot of my drawings. Every year I gift my grandparents and parents with my drawing on their birthdays because they are very fond of my drawings and always encourage me to practice more. Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing. My leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps and is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.
